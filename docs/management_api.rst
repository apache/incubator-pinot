Management REST API
-------------------

There is a REST API which allows management of tables, tenants, segments and schemas. It can be accessed by going to ``http://[controller host]/help`` which offers a web UI to do these tasks, as well as document the REST API.

It can be used instead of the ``pinot-admin.sh`` commands to automate the creation of tables and tenants.
